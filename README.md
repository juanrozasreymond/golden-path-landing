 The Golden Path is a new way to handle money, designed for everyone, everywhere.
 It’s a financial system that runs on your smartphone, free from banks, corporations, or
 governments. Imagine sending, saving, or borrowing money directly with others, using
 just an app, without anyone taking a cut or controlling your choices.
 This vision comes from Juan Rozas Reymond, who saw a better way to manage money—
 one that puts people first. The Golden Path isn’t owned by a company; it’s a public
 project, open to anyone who wants to use it or help build it.
